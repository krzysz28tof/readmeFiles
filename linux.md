# General Arch Info

## neofetch / fastfetch
- just a small, quick CLI tool to display system info


<!-- Filesystem -->

## Filesystem

In **/usr/bin** binary files are stored.

/bin has essential binaries, before /usr is mounted. However afterwards, it's same.

In **/usr/sbin** binaries are stored which need *superuser (root)* privilages.

In **/usr/local** files are stored, which aren't managed by the system packages.

### IOS USB multiplexing
**usbmuxd** is a library and a deamon that keeps trying to connect to IOS devices.

sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd.service

but it gets triggered by other services

sudo systemctl list-dependencies usbmuxd.service

instead, try: 
usbmuxd -n 
(equivalent to --disable-hotplug)

this prevents from discovering devices automatically
