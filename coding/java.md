## Java compilation
Java code compiles into bytecode, which then gets compiled into machine code by the **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM). <br>

Therefore java code can be compiled once, and then run on any machine having an JVM.

## JDK, JRE, JVM
The **Java Runtime Environment** (JRE) includes everything to run a java program, however, it doesn't include any tools to create a java program (i.e. no compiler). <br>
The **Java Development Kit** (JDK) includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and other tools, such as libraries and compilation tools, to develop java programs.

### JDKs
There are two official JDKs: **OpenJDK** and Oracle JDK. <br>
OpenJDK is free and open source and doesn't lack in performance.
